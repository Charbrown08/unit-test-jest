# Jest Learning Repository

Welcome to my Jest Learning Repository! 🎉

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a playground for exploring and mastering Jest, a delightful JavaScript testing framework. As I dive into Jest, this repo serves as a sandbox to experiment with various features, patterns, and best practices.

## 🛠️ What to Expect

In this repo, you'll find:

- **Basic Test Cases:** Examples of simple unit tests to get started with Jest.
- **Mocking:** How to mock functions, modules, and other dependencies.
- **Asynchronous Testing:** Techniques to handle promises and async/await in tests.
- **Code Coverage:** Insights into measuring how much of your code is covered by tests.
- **Configuration:** Custom Jest configurations and setup to suit different testing needs.

## 📚 Learning Goals

Here’s what I aim to achieve with this repository:

- Understand Jest’s core concepts and capabilities.
- Write clean, efficient, and reliable tests for my code.
- Explore advanced Jest features like snapshots and test-driven development (TDD).
